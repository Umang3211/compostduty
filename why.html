<h1> Why did we make this product? </h1>

<p> - To help highlight the importance of composting and being transparent through the process. </p>

<p> - To educate the PDS community and making information about composting accessilble to everyone, just through their computer/device.</p>

<p> - To make the composting system a more easy, fun, and educational process! </p>
      <p>*Ms. Flory was interveiwed for this, and had a part in adding to this </p>

<h1> What did we make?</h1>
<p>We desgined a product that uploads weight sensor data, that uses an HX11 weight sensor, and an esp32 board; which uploads the weight of the compost buckets to the web, for all to see.</p>
